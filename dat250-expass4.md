### Experiment 1 : Spark/Java Framework project and Postman

In my other assignments I have used IntelliJ as my IDE, but for some reason the program would not run when i imported it. I have spent a great deal of time trying to solve problems outside of the actual assignment, therefore i decided to change my IDE to Eclipse for this assignment as I am more familiar with it and I knew other people did not have the same problem with Eclipse.

The experiment in it self went fine. The Postman Desktop Agent was easy to work with. I tried it with Safari first, but discovered it didnt work there so i switvhed to Google Chrome.
Screenshots from this experiment:

### Experiment 2: REST API for TODO-items

I copied the Todo-class from the given link in the assignment in to the project used in the previous experiment.

I found it a bit difficult to get started and know what to do/where to begin with this experiment, but after Patrick explained in the lab on Wednesday it got clearer. 

In the Todo-Class i added an id (long) which increments automatically and in the App-Class I created a HashMap of todo-items. I had to change my port a few times during the project as I had some problems with the connection working when i ran the program over again, which is why the port changes in some of the screenshots between "5555" and "8080".
