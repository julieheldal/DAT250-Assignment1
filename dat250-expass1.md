# DAT250-Assignment1


I downloaded JDK, Git Client and IntelliJ IDEA without problems, but I am not sure if the maven download is done correctly. 

I created an account and followed the Heroku tutorial. I stumbled upon some issues during the "mvn clean install" section and had to use the alternative "./mvnw clean install", hence why I think I have downloaded maven the wrong way. I also had some problems when connecting to the database as I did not have postgresSQL installed, but the error on the command "heroku pg:pqsl" pointed towards a tutorial that helped me fix the issue. I chose not to do the optional step with addons due to the requirements. Other than that the tutorial was easy to follow.
