# **Assignment 7**

I found the tutorial a bit hard to understand besides just writing the same code they did, so I used some time to understand it properly, I also found the jar files a mess. 
The terminal commands didnt work in the beginning and I also used some time to figure out what was going to work. I have no pending issues.
